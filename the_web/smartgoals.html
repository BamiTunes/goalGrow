        <h2>What are SMART Goals?</h2>
       <p>
        Setting effective goals is crucial for achieving success in any area of life, whether
        personal, professional, or academic. One of the most widely recommended methods for goal
        setting is the SMART criteria. The SMART framework helps you define clear, attainable 
        goals that are easier to measure and track. But what exactly does SMART stand for? </p>

    <h2>S - Specific</h2>
    <p>
        A specific goal is clear and unambiguous. It answers the fundamental questions: 
        Who? What? Where? When? Why? A goal that is too vague won't provide you with 
        the direction you need, and it will be harder to stay focused. To make your 
        goal specific, consider the following aspects:
        <ul>
            <li>What exactly do I want to achieve?</li>
            <li>Why is this goal important?</li>
            <li>Who is involved in achieving this goal?</li>
            <li>Where will this goal take place?</li>
            <li>When do I want to accomplish this goal?</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
