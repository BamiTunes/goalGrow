    <h1>What are SMART Goals?</h1>
    <section>
    <p>
        Setting effective goals is crucial for achieving success in any area of life, whether
        personal, professional, or academic. One of the most widely recommended methods for goal
        setting is the SMART criteria. The SMART framework helps you define clear, attainable 
        goals that are easier to measure and track. But what exactly does SMART stand for? 
    </p>

    <h2>S - Specific</h2>
    <p>
        A specific goal is clear and unambiguous. It answers the fundamental questions: 
        Who? What? Where? When? Why? A goal that is too vague won't provide you with 
        the direction you need, and it will be harder to stay focused. To make your 
        goal specific, consider the following aspects:
        <ul>
            <li>What exactly do I want to achieve?</li>
            <li>Why is this goal important?</li>
            <li>Who is involved in achieving this goal?</li>
            <li>Where will this goal take place?</li>
            <li>When do I want to accomplish this goal?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            Example of a Specific Goal:"I want to complete a 5-kilometer race to improve my 
            fitness and raise money for a charity by the end of September."By making the goal specific,
            it becomes easier to plan and measure your progress.
        </div>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>M - Measurable</h2>
        A measurable goal is one that can be tracked. You need a way to evaluate progress and know 
        when the goal has been reached. 
        Ask yourself: <br>
        <br>
        How will I know when the goal is accomplished?
        What are the indicators of success?
        Can I track my progress along the way?
        Having a measurable goal helps you stay motivated as you reach milestones. It also gives you a
        sense of achievement as you see how far you've come.
        <br>
        Example of a Measurable Goal:
        <div class="example">
            "I will run 3 times a week for 30 minutes and track my distance each time using a fitness 
            app."
        In this case, the measurable aspect is the frequency and duration of the runs, which you can easily monitor.
        </div>
            </section>
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2> A - Achievable </h2>
        <p>
            An achievable goal is realistic and within your reach. It should stretch your abilities,
             but not be so far out of reach that it feels impossible. While it's important to be ambitious, setting a goal that is too difficult can lead to frustration and demotivation. Consider:
Can I realistically achieve this goal, given my current resources and constraints?
Do I need any additional skills, tools, or support?
Setting achievable goals often involves breaking larger goals into smaller, more manageable steps. This way, you can make gradual progress and stay focused.
<div class="example">
    Example of an Achievable Goal:
"I will read one chapter of a book every day and finish this book within 3 weeks."
While this goal might be challenging for some, itâ€™s achievable because it's broken down into small, consistent actions.
</div>
     </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>R - Relevant</h2>
        <p>
            A relevant goal aligns with your values and long-term objectives. It's important that the goal you set is meaningful to you, as it will drive motivation 
            and commitment. 
            <br>
            Ask yourself: <br>
            Does this goal matter to me?Is it aligned with my 
            broader life objectives?
Will it help me move closer to where I want to be in life?
A relevant goal should feel important and worthwhile. It should support your larger mission 
and not just be 
something that sounds good in the moment.

<div class="example">
    Example of a Relevant Goal:
"I want to get a promotion at work so I can be financially stable and have more opportunities to advance my career."
This goal is relevant because it ties into personal ambitions and long-term career growth.
</div>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>T - Time-Bound</h2>
        <p>
            A time-bound goal has a specific deadline or timeframe. This is essential for maintaining
             focus and urgency. Without a timeline, goals can easily be pushed aside. Ask yourself:
             When do I want to achieve this goal?
What can I accomplish in the next few weeks, months, or year?
What specific date will I set to review or evaluate my progress?
Setting a timeline gives you a sense of urgency and prevents procrastination. It also provides a clear 
end-point to measure success.

<div class="example">
    Example of a Time-bound Goal:
"I will complete my professional certification by December 15th."
<br>
This goal has a clear deadline, ensuring that you stay motivated and on track to meet it.
</div>
        </p>
